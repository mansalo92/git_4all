    "**Business Context.** Animal models are commonly used to study spinal cord injuries in humans. Thus, technological advances made in veterinary medicine for spinal cord injury (and other areas that commonly rely on animal models) are often made with an eye towards the eventual development of a product for humans.  One such advancement is the development of a SNAP-test (a test that can be run in a few minutes from a single blood draw) that can be used to predict if the patient will likely recover from the injury.  This information is valuable for doctors and clinical practitioners.  If the information collected in the SNAP-test proves to have sufficient predictive power, then investigators will pursue a patent and bring the product to market. The primary alternative to a SNAP-test is a traditional lab test which is more time and resource intensive; the time required to obtain results from a traditional lab test delays treatment decisions which can adversely affect patient outcomes.  \n",

Because the sample size is small it would valuable to run a follow-up (confirmatory) evaluation of a recovery predictive model based on GFAP. Recall that these samples were taken from an existing archive of blood samples and patient follow-up data.  It may be possible to simply pull more samples from this archive to evaluate the performance of a predictive model based on GFAP.   In terms of next steps, one could fit a classification model to identify an optimal cut point, e.g, a classifier of the form: predict recovery (response) if GFAP < c and predict non-recovery (non-response) otherwise.  One could also probably just pick a value from the plot.  In terms of potential pitfalls, samples were collected from a single location and may not be representative of the larger population of patients.  Furthermore, the subjects in this sample where from dogs that were taken to the hospital by their owners, thus, they may be more likely to come from homes with more resources (e.g., the ability and willingness to pay potentially large veterinary bills). Thus, these predictive models may not be accurate for a larger population of dogs (does this matter? Why? or Why not?).  "
