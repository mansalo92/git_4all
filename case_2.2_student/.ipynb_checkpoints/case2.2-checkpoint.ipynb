Features of these apps include services like remote ignition, GPS location, and anti-theft mechanisms as well as online scheduling, maintenance reminders, and promotion pushes.  Manufacturers are interested in maximizing engagement with their app because they feel that this increases relationship depth and brand loyalty with the customer. However, app usage is often limited with customers abandoning the app after only a short time or never even opening it. You are a data scientist for a large luxury auto-mobile company. Your company wants you to find out behavioral patterns in the users who engage with the app. The hope is that if you can find discernible patterns, your company can learn from those patterns and give users incentives to use the app more frequently.\n",
